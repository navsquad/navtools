## 🚀 Our Mission <a name = "our-mission"></a>

***navtools.py*** was created to provide a diverse foundation of tools that can be used to facilitate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) research in Python. 

We are still very much in development as features are being added on an as-needed basis. Feel free to request new features as an [issue](https://github.com/tannerkoza/navtools.py/issues/new) or see [Contributing](#contributing) for instructions on adding your own tools.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting-started"></a>

***navtools.py*** is fairly easy to get installed (if not submit an issue!). Currently, the package only exists in this repo as we are "pre-release". However, there are plans to distribute wheels on PyPI in the future. For now, read through the following instructions for getting started.

## Prerequisites

Python **3.9-3.12** is required. We are currently working to make the package usable with Python 3.9 or greater.

## Installation

1. Clone ***navtools.py***.

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tannerkoza/navtools.py.git
```

**Note:** The `--recurse-submodules` flag is currently necessary to use [laika](https://github.com/tannerkoza/laika.git) as a dependency.


2. Install in a virtual environment or base Python (not recommended) using `pip`.
```
pip install navtools.py/
```

It's that simple! If you find yourself having trouble, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/tannerkoza/navtools.py/issues/new).

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

So, how do we get started?

As we are "pre-release", there is currently no hosted documentation. However, much of the functionality can be seen in the [examples](https://github.com/tannerkoza/navtools.py/tree/main/examples) folder. Also, most functions and classes should have docstrings explaining parameters and general functionality.

 If you have any questions, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/tannerkoza/navtools.py/issues/new) as we work on documentation.
